This ability does not prevent any accuracy losses other than stat modifiers, such as the accuracy cut from fog; nor does it prevent other Pokémon's evasion from making this Pokémon's moves less accurate.  This Pokémon can still be passed negative accuracy modifiers through heart swap.  Overworld: If the first Pokémon in the party has this ability, any random encounter with a Pokémon five or more levels lower than it has a 50% chance of being skipped.","description":"Prevents loss of accuracy."},{"name":"Skill Link","effect":"This Pokémon always hits five times with two-to-five-hit moves, such as icicle spear.  It also bypasses the accuracy checks on triple kick's second and third hits.","description":"Increases the frequency of multi-strike moves."},{"name":"Sheer Force","effect":"This Pokémon's moves with extra effects have 1.3× their power, but lose their extra effects.  An effect chance is a move's chance to inflict a status ailment, cause a stat change, or make the target flinch in addition to the move's main effect. For example, thunder shock's paralysis is an extra effect, but thunder wave's is not, nor are knock off's item removal and air cutter's increased critical hit rate.  Moves that lower the user's stats are unaffected.","description":"Removes added effects to increase move damage."}],"stats":{"HP":80,"Attack":120,"Defense":75,"Special Attack":75,"Special Defense":75,"Speed":60},"locations":[],"color":"#b2b0af"}
