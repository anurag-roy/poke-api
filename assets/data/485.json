Once this Pokémon has been hit by a Fire move, its own Fire moves will inflict 1.5× as much damage until it leaves battle.  This ability has no effect while the Pokémon is frozen.  The Fire damage bonus is retained even if the Pokémon is frozen and thawed or the ability is lost or disabled.  Fire moves will ignore this Pokémon's substitute.  This ability takes effect even on non-damaging moves, i.e. will o wisp.","description":"Powers up if hit by fire."},{"name":"Flame Body","effect":"Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, the move's user has a 30% chance of being burned.  Overworld: If any Pokémon in the party has this ability, each egg in the party has its hatch counter decreased by 2 (rather than 1) each step cycle, making eggs hatch roughly twice as quickly.  This effect does not stack if multiple Pokémon have this ability or magma armor.","description":"Burns the foe on contact."}],"stats":{"HP":91,"Attack":90,"Defense":106,"Special Attack":130,"Special Defense":106,"Speed":77},"locations":[],"color":"#62311f"}
