An effect chance is a move's chance to inflict a status ailment, cause a stat change, or make the target flinch in addition to the move's main effect. For example, thunder shock's paralysis is an extra effect, but thunder wave's is not, nor are knock off's item removal and air cutter's increased critical hit rate.  Moves that lower the user's stats are unaffected.","description":"Removes added effects to increase move damage."}],"stats":{"HP":70,"Attack":120,"Defense":100,"Special Attack":145,"Special Defense":105,"Speed":20},"locations":[]}
