{"id":701,"name":"Hawlucha","genus":"Wrestling Pokémon","description":"Although its body is small, its proficient fighting skills enable it to keep up with big bruisers like Machamp and Hariyama.","imageUrl":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anurag-roy/poke-api/main/assets/images/701.webp","types":["Fighting","Flying"],"abilities":[{"name":"Limber","effect":"This Pokémon cannot be paralyzed.  If a Pokémon is paralyzed and acquires this ability, its paralysis is healed; this includes when regaining a lost ability upon leaving battle.","description":"Prevents paralysis."},{"name":"Unburden","effect":"When this Pokémon uses or loses its held item, its Speed is doubled.  If it gains another item or leaves battle, this bonus is lost.  This includes when the Pokémon drops its item because of knock off.  This bonus does not count as a stat modifier.  There is no notification when this ability takes effect.","description":"Raises Speed if a held item is used."},{"name":"Mold Breaker","effect":"This Pokémon's moves completely ignore abilities that could hinder or prevent their effect on the target.  For example, this Pokémon's moves ignore abilities that would fully negate them, such as water absorb; abilities that would prevent any of their effects, such as clear body, shell armor, or sticky hold; and abilities that grant any general protective benefit, such as simple, snow cloak, or thick fat.  If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. dry skin or unaware, the ability is ignored either way.  Abilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected.  For example, cursed body only affects potential future uses of the move, while liquid ooze and shadow tag can only hinder a move's effect on the user.  This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example color change or forecast; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from drizzle.  This ability cannot ignore multitype at all.  An ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used.  For example, this Pokémon's moves can paralyze a Pokémon with limber, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed.  When this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability.  This ability functions identically to teravolt and turboblaze.","description":"Moves can be used regardless of abilities."}],"stats":{"HP":78,"Attack":92,"Defense":75,"Special Attack":74,"Special Defense":63,"Speed":118},"locations":["Route 10"],"color":"#fdfeff"}
