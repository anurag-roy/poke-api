Effectively, this affects modifiers of every stat except Speed.  The power of punishment and stored power is calculated as usual.

This Pokémon also cannot use fling.  The Speed cut from the iron ball and the effort items (the macho brace, power weight, power bracer, power belt, power lens, power band, and power anklet) is unaffected.  Items that do not directly affect the battle, such as the exp share, the amulet coin, or the soothe bell, work as usual.  All held items work as usual out of battle.  Other moves that use the held item, such as natural gift and switcheroo, work as usual.","description":"The Pokémon can't use any held items."},{"name":"Simple","effect":"Each stage of this Pokémon's stat modifiers acts as two stages.  These doubled stages are still limited to a minimum of -6 and a maximum of 6.  This Pokémon can still accumulate less than -3 or more than 3 stages of stat modifiers, even though the extra ones have no effect after doubling.","description":"The Pokémon is prone to wild stat changes."}],"stats":{"HP":67,"Attack":57,"Defense":55,"Special Attack":77,"Special Defense":55,"Speed":114},"locations":[],"color":"#b5b4b4"}
