An effect chance is a move's chance to inflict a status ailment, cause a stat change, or make the target flinch in addition to the move's main effect. For example, thunder shock's paralysis is an extra effect, but thunder wave's is not, nor are knock off's item removal and air cutter's increased critical hit rate.  Moves that lower the user's stats are unaffected.","description":"Removes added effects to increase move damage."},{"name":"Zen Mode","effect":"This Pokémon switches between Standard Mode and Zen Mode after each turn depending on its HP.  Below 50% of its maximum HP, it switches to Zen Mode, and at 50% or above, it switches to Standard Mode.  This Pokémon returns to Standard Mode upon leaving battle or losing this ability.
