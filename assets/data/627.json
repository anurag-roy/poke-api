This ability does not prevent any accuracy losses other than stat modifiers, such as the accuracy cut from fog; nor does it prevent other Pokémon's evasion from making this Pokémon's moves less accurate.  This Pokémon can still be passed negative accuracy modifiers through heart swap.  Overworld: If the first Pokémon in the party has this ability, any random encounter with a Pokémon five or more levels lower than it has a 50% chance of being skipped.","description":"Prevents loss of accuracy."},{"name":"Sheer Force","effect":"This Pokémon's moves with extra effects have 1.3× their power, but lose their extra effects.  An effect chance is a move's chance to inflict a status ailment, cause a stat change, or make the target flinch in addition to the move's main effect. For example, thunder shock's paralysis is an extra effect, but thunder wave's is not, nor are knock off's item removal and air cutter's increased critical hit rate.  Moves that lower the user's stats are unaffected.","description":"Removes added effects to increase move damage."},{"name":"Hustle","effect":"This Pokémon's physical moves do 1.5× as much regular damage, but have 0.8× their usual accuracy.  Special moves are unaffected.  Moves that do set damage, such as seismic toss, have their accuracy affected, but not their damage.  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, higher-levelled Pokémon have their encounter rate increased.","description":"Trades accuracy for power."}],"stats":{"HP":70,"Attack":83,"Defense":50,"Special Attack":37,"Special Defense":50,"Speed":60},"locations":["Victory Road","Village Bridge","Route 10","Route 11","Route 23"],"color":"#c1c1c8"}
