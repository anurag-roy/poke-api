Regardless of its current HP, it is also immune to the one-hit KO moves: fissure, guillotine, horn drill, and sheer cold.  If this Pokémon is holding a focus sash, this ability takes precedence and the item will not be consumed.","description":"Negates 1-hit KO attacks."},{"name":"Sheer Force","effect":"This Pokémon's moves with extra effects have 1.3× their power, but lose their extra effects.  An effect chance is a move's chance to inflict a status ailment, cause a stat change, or make the target flinch in addition to the move's main effect. For example, thunder shock's paralysis is an extra effect, but thunder wave's is not, nor are knock off's item removal and air cutter's increased critical hit rate.  Moves that lower the user's stats are unaffected.","description":"Removes added effects to increase move damage."}],"stats":{"HP":75,"Attack":85,"Defense":200,"Special Attack":55,"Special Defense":65,"Speed":30},"locations":["Victory Road","Snowpoint Temple","Iron Island","Mt.
