This ability does not prevent any accuracy losses other than stat modifiers, such as the accuracy cut from fog; nor does it prevent other Pokémon's evasion from making this Pokémon's moves less accurate.  This Pokémon can still be passed negative accuracy modifiers through heart swap.  Overworld: If the first Pokémon in the party has this ability, any random encounter with a Pokémon five or more levels lower than it has a 50% chance of being skipped.","description":"Prevents loss of accuracy."},{"name":"Vital Spirit","effect":"This Pokémon cannot be asleep.  This causes rest to fail altogether.  If a Pokémon is asleep and acquires this ability, it will immediately wake up; this includes when regaining a lost ability upon leaving battle.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, higher-levelled Pokémon have their encounter rate increased.","description":"Prevents sleep."},{"name":"No Guard","effect":"Moves used by or against this Pokémon never miss.  One-hit KO moves are unaffected.  Moves affected by this ability can hit Pokémon during the preparation turn of moves like dig or fly.
