This ability does not prevent any accuracy losses other than stat modifiers, such as the accuracy cut from fog; nor does it prevent other Pokémon's evasion from making this Pokémon's moves less accurate.  This Pokémon can still be passed negative accuracy modifiers through heart swap.  Overworld: If the first Pokémon in the party has this ability, any random encounter with a Pokémon five or more levels lower than it has a 50% chance of being skipped.","description":"Prevents loss of accuracy."},{"name":"Sheer Force","effect":"This Pokémon's moves with extra effects have 1.3× their power, but lose their extra effects.  An effect chance is a move's chance to inflict a status ailment, cause a stat change, or make the target flinch in addition to the move's main effect. For example, thunder shock's paralysis is an extra effect, but thunder wave's is not, nor are knock off's item removal and air cutter's increased critical hit rate.  Moves that lower the user's stats are unaffected.","description":"Removes added effects to increase move damage."},{"name":"Defiant","effect":"When any of this Pokémon's stats are lowered, its Attack rises by two stages.  If multiple stats are lowered at once, this ability takes effect with each stat lowered.","description":"When its stats are lowered its Attack increases."}],"stats":{"HP":100,"Attack":123,"Defense":75,"Special Attack":57,"Special Defense":75,"Speed":80},"locations":["Village Bridge","Route 11"],"color":"#b6b5ba"}
