Its docile-looking face serves to lull its foe into letting down its guard. When the foe least expects it, MAWHILE chomps it with its gaping jaws.","types":["Steel","Fairy"],"abilities":[{"name":"Hyper Cutter","effect":"This Pokémon's Attack cannot be lowered by other Pokémon.  This ability does not prevent any Attack losses other than stat modifiers, such as the Attack cut from a burn.  This Pokémon can still be passed negative Attack modifiers through heart swap or power swap.","description":"Prevents ATTACK reduction."},{"name":"Intimidate","effect":"When this Pokémon enters battle, the opponent's Attack is lowered by one stage.  In a double battle, both opponents are affected.  This ability also takes effect when acquired during a battle, but will not take effect again if lost and reobtained without leaving battle.  This ability has no effect on an opponent that has a substitute.  Overworld: If the first Pokémon in the party has this ability, any random encounter with a Pokémon five or more levels lower than it has a 50% chance of being skipped.","description":"Lowers the foe’s ATTACK."},{"name":"Sheer Force","effect":"This Pokémon's moves with extra effects have 1.3× their power, but lose their extra effects.  An effect chance is a move's chance to inflict a status ailment, cause a stat change, or make the target flinch in addition to the move's main effect. For example, thunder shock's paralysis is an extra effect, but thunder wave's is not, nor are knock off's item removal and air cutter's increased critical hit rate.  Moves that lower the user's stats are unaffected.","description":"Removes added effects to increase move damage."}],"stats":{"HP":50,"Attack":85,"Defense":85,"Special Attack":55,"Special Defense":55,"Speed":50},"locations":["Iron Island","Route 9","Granite Cave","Cave of Origin","Victory Road","Sky Pillar","Challenger's Cave","Glittering Cave"]}
