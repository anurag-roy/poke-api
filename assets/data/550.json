{"id":550,"name":"Basculin","genus":"Hostile Pokémon","description":"Red and blue Basculin get along so poorly, they'll start fighting instantly. These Pokémon are very hostile.","imageUrl":"https://pub-460ada4f152c4135a7ec0881a2cb1330.r2.dev/550.webp","types":["Water"],"abilities":[{"name":"Reckless","effect":"This Pokémon's recoil moves and crash moves have 1.2× their base power.  struggle is unaffected.  The \"crash moves\" are the moves that damage the user upon missing: jump kick and high jump kick.","description":"Powers up moves that have recoil damage."},{"name":"Adaptability","effect":"This Pokémon inflicts twice as much damage with moves whose types match its own, rather than the usual same-type attack bonus of 1.5×.","description":"Powers up moves of the same type."},{"name":"Mold Breaker","effect":"This Pokémon's moves completely ignore abilities that could hinder or prevent their effect on the target.  For example, this Pokémon's moves ignore abilities that would fully negate them, such as water absorb; abilities that would prevent any of their effects, such as clear body, shell armor, or sticky hold; and abilities that grant any general protective benefit, such as simple, snow cloak, or thick fat.  If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. dry skin or unaware, the ability is ignored either way.  Abilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected.  For example, cursed body only affects potential future uses of the move, while liquid ooze and shadow tag can only hinder a move's effect on the user.  This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example color change or forecast; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from drizzle.  This ability cannot ignore multitype at all.  An ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used.  For example, this Pokémon's moves can paralyze a Pokémon with limber, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed.  When this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability.  This ability functions identically to teravolt and turboblaze.","description":"Moves can be used regardless of abilities."}],"stats":{"HP":70,"Attack":92,"Defense":65,"Special Attack":80,"Special Defense":55,"Speed":98},"locations":["Striaton City","Pinwheel Forest","Dragonspiral Tower","Victory Road","Giant Chasm","Village Bridge","Route 1","Route 3","Wellspring Cave","Route 6","Challenger's Cave","Route 11","Route 13","Route 14","Abundant Shrine","Lostlorn Forest","Undella Town","Aspertia City","Humilau City","Floccesy Ranch","Relic Passage","Clay Tunnel","Nature Sanctuary","Route 19","Route 20","Route 22","Route 23","Couriway Town","Laverre City","Route 15","Route 16","Route 21","Frost Cavern","Pokémon Village"],"color":"#c1dfc7"}
