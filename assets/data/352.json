This ability takes effect on only the last hit of a multiple-hit attack.  In Pokémon Colosseum and XD: Gale of Darkness, this ability does not take effect on Shadow-type moves.","description":"Changes type to foe’s move."},{"name":"Protean","effect":"Changes the bearer's type to match each move it uses.
