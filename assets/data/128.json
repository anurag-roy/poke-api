In a double battle, both opponents are affected.  This ability also takes effect when acquired during a battle, but will not take effect again if lost and reobtained without leaving battle.  This ability has no effect on an opponent that has a substitute.  Overworld: If the first Pokémon in the party has this ability, any random encounter with a Pokémon five or more levels lower than it has a 50% chance of being skipped.","description":"Lowers the foe’s ATTACK."},{"name":"Anger Point","effect":"Whenever this Pokémon receives a critical hit, its Attack rises to the maximum of 6 stages.  This ability will still take effect if the critical hit is received by a substitute.","description":"Raises Attack upon taking a critical hit."},{"name":"Sheer Force","effect":"This Pokémon's moves with extra effects have 1.3× their power, but lose their extra effects.  An effect chance is a move's chance to inflict a status ailment, cause a stat change, or make the target flinch in addition to the move's main effect. For example, thunder shock's paralysis is an extra effect, but thunder wave's is not, nor are knock off's item removal and air cutter's increased critical hit rate.  Moves that lower the user's stats are unaffected.","description":"Removes added effects to increase move damage."}],"stats":{"HP":75,"Attack":100,"Defense":95,"Special Attack":40,"Special Defense":70,"Speed":110},"locations":["Route 209","Route 210","Route 38","Route 39","Route 48","Safari Zone","Route 12"]}
