Pokémon with run away can still flee.  Pokémon can still switch out with the use of a move or item.  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is doubled.","description":"Prevents fleeing."},{"name":"Sheer Force","effect":"This Pokémon's moves with extra effects have 1.3× their power, but lose their extra effects.  An effect chance is a move's chance to inflict a status ailment, cause a stat change, or make the target flinch in addition to the move's main effect. For example, thunder shock's paralysis is an extra effect, but thunder wave's is not, nor are knock off's item removal and air cutter's increased critical hit rate.  Moves that lower the user's stats are unaffected.","description":"Removes added effects to increase move damage."}],"stats":{"HP":45,"Attack":100,"Defense":45,"Special Attack":45,"Special Defense":45,"Speed":10},"locations":["Route 228","Route 111","Mirage Tower","Desert Resort","Reversal Mountain","Route 13"],"color":"#f9d7c8"}
