This ability stacks if multiple targets have it.  This ability still affects moves that fail or miss.  This ability does not affect ally moves that target either the entire field or just its side, nor this Pokémon's self-targetted moves; it does, however, affect single-targetted ally moves aimed at this Pokémon, ally moves that target all other Pokémon, and opponents' moves that target the entire field.  If this ability raises a move's PP cost above its remaining PP, it will use all remaining PP.  When this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability.  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, higher-levelled Pokémon have their encounter rate increased.","description":"Raises foe's PP usage."},{"name":"Flame Body","effect":"Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, the move's user has a 30% chance of being burned.  Overworld: If any Pokémon in the party has this ability, each egg in the party has its hatch counter decreased by 2 (rather than 1) each step cycle, making eggs hatch roughly twice as quickly.
